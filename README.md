# Shuttle

Refer to the project website, documentation, and demo app as a starting point and for more details.

Shuttle provides a modern, guarded way to pass parcelable data with Intents, or saving parcelable data in Bundle objects
to avoid app crashes.   With Shuttle, one no longer needs to rely on code reviewers to catch cases where the Parcelable objects may be too large.   Shuttle stores
the Parcelable, passes an identifier for the Parcelable, and enables retrieval of the stored parcelable at the 
destination. 

## Architecture
This project provides the both the solution and solution building block framework.
