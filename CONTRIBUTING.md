# How to contribute
Contributions are welcome.


# Reporting issues

We use the GitHub issue tracker to track bugs, feature requests and questions.

Before filing a new issue, please search the tracker to check if it's already covered by an existing report. Avoiding duplicates helps us maximize the time we can spend fixing bugs and adding new features.

When filing an issue, be sure to provide enough information for us to efficiently diagnose and reproduce the problem. In particular, please include all the information requested in the issue template.


# Branching Strategies and Pull Requests
When contributing, the project must first be forked, and the PR should target the "develop" branch.

Changes in pull requests should adhere to best practices, principles, and styling.  Effort should be made to align with architectural attributes, such as readability, maintainability, etc.
